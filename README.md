## My process

Nothing much here, trust me.
I put all my text and img in a container, then style my container to be at the center of the page. Added a section before the container which was really paddedðŸ˜ƒ. Then styling other things come easily.
Major thing here, was displaying flex the (eth icon and text) with the (clock and text).

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
-

### What I learned

Really struggled with the equilibrium hover effect that display the view iconðŸ˜¥, glad i could see the end of it.

### Continued development

I will continue to learn, unlearn and relearn till web design become a natural thing.
